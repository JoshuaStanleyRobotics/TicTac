This repository includes the CAD (.step), code (.ino), and printing (STL) files for TicTac, an Arduino powered two wheel balancing robot.

The CAD and code for the remote control can be found in its own repository at https://github.com/JoshuaStanleyRobotics/Robot-Remote

A video outlining the design and assembly of TicTac can be found here: https://youtu.be/M-bemH251Hs

## Components
TicTac uses the custom MicroBot Control Board, Voltage Regulator, and Stepper Shield. The design files for these PCBs can be found in their own repository at https://github.com/JoshuaStanleyRobotics/MicroBot

This design also uses two Nema 17 stepper motors, an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit, and a 2S LiPo battery (I used https://us.ovonicshop.com/products/2-ovonic-11-1v-80c-800mah-2s-lipo-battery-with-jst-plug-for-250-helicopters-800mm-warbird?_pos=1&_psq=800maH+2&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
